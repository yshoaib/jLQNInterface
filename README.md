jLQNInterface
=============
jLQNInterface provides Java API to solve, analyze and manipulate Layered Qeueuing Network (LQN) models. A sample input model and an algorithm that finds bottlenecks and meets given response time objectives are included in the repository. 

Maven
======
```
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/ca.appsimulations/jLQNInterface -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>ca.appsimulations</groupId>
    <artifactId>jLQNInterface</artifactId>
    <version>LATEST.VERSION.NUMBER</version>
</dependency>
```

Pre-requisite
==============
jLQNInterface depends on LQN Solver (LQNS), which needs to be installed on the system before jLQNInterface may be used.
