jLQNInterface
=============

jLQNInterface provides Java API to manipulate Layered Qeueuing Network (LQN) models. A sample input model and an algorithm that finds bottlenecks and meets given response time objectives are included in the repository. 

jLQNInterface depends on LQN Solver (LQNS), which needs to be installed on the system before jLQNInterface may be used.
